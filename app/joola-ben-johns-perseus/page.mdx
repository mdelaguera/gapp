Surprising pop for a control-oriented paddle. The carbon fiber surface generates excellent drive power without feeling "dead" on defensive shots.

## Detailed Analysis

### **Feel & Touch**
The Perseus has a crisp, responsive feel that gives excellent feedback. You know immediately when you've hit a clean shot versus mishit. The sweet spot is generous enough for intermediate players while rewarding precise contact.

### **Maneuverability** 
At 8.0-8.4 oz, it's perfectly balanced for quick hands exchanges. The handle length and grip circumference work well for most hand sizes.

### **Sound**
Produces a satisfying "pop" on drives and a controlled "thock" on dinks. Not the loudest paddle on court, but has a premium sound signature.
