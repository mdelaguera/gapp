## Detailed Analysis

### **Raw Carbon Surface**
The textured raw carbon fiber surface provides exceptional grip on the ball. This translates to more spin on your shots and better control on resets and dinks.

### **Value Proposition**
At $99.99 (or $89.99 with discounts), you're getting technology typically found in $150+ paddles. The cost savings come from simpler graphics and packaging, not performance compromises.

### **Weight & Feel**
Well-balanced at 7.9-8.3 oz with a comfortable grip. The paddle feels substantial without being unwieldy.
