## Performance Breakdown

### **Power: 4.9/5** ‚ö°
Surprising pop for a control-oriented paddle. The carbon fiber surface generates excellent drive power without feeling "dead" on defensive shots.

### **Control: 4.7/5** üéØ
Where this paddle truly shines. Precision dinks, resets, and touch shots feel effortless. You can place the ball exactly where you want it.

### **Spin: 4.8/5** üå™Ô∏è
The Carbon Friction Surface (CFS) grips the ball beautifully. Topspin drives and slice serves get noticeably more bite.

### **Durability: 4.6/5** üõ°Ô∏è
Solid construction that holds up to regular play. The edge guard is robust and the surface maintains its texture over time.

- **Intermediate+ players** (3.5+ skill level)
- **Control-first play styles**

## Detailed Analysis

### **Feel & Touch**
The Perseus has a crisp, responsive feel that gives excellent feedback. You know immediately when you've hit a clean shot versus mishit. The sweet spot is generous enough for intermediate players while rewarding precise contact.

### **Maneuverability** 
At 8.0-8.4 oz, it's perfectly balanced for quick hands exchanges. The handle length and grip circumference work well for most hand sizes.

### **Sound**
Produces a satisfying "pop" on drives and a controlled "thock" on dinks. Not the loudest paddle on court, but has a premium sound signature.
